# Adaptive-Joint-Compression
This repository contain the framework for Bayesian Joint Compression (BJC) of deep models for Edge scenarios. By using learnable gate variables that control the quantization precision and the rank of decomposed layers, the model can adaptively determine the most efficient configuration for each layer during training.
